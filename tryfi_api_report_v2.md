- **Not Found**: Historical locations, activity feed, walk history

### 6. Household Features
- **Available**: Multiple pets per household
- **Available**: Multiple bases per household
- **Not Found**: Household members, places, geofences

## Integration Enhancement Opportunities

Based on the available API features, here are the recommended enhancements:

### 1. Improve Existing Features
- **Rest/Sleep Tracking**: Add sensors for daily/weekly/monthly sleep and nap duration
- **Activity Zones**: Use area name from ongoing activity for zone-based automations
- **Connection Quality**: Expose base station connection quality
- **Photo Integration**: Add pet photo as entity picture

### 2. Add New Sensors
- **Age Sensor**: Calculate pet age from birth date
- **Activity Type Sensor**: Current activity (walk/rest) as a state
- **Place Sensor**: Current place name when resting
- **Area Sensor**: Current area name from location data

### 3. Enhance Device Control
- **LED Scheduler**: Service to schedule LED on/off times
- **Battery Alerts**: Low battery notifications based on device data
- **Connection Monitoring**: Track last connection time and type

### 4. Statistics and Trends
- **Goal Progress**: Percentage of daily/weekly goals achieved
- **Activity Trends**: Compare current vs previous period
- **Rest Quality**: Sleep vs nap ratio analysis

## Limitations Discovered

1. **No GraphQL Introspection**: The API blocks schema introspection queries
2. **Limited Historical Data**: Only current/summary data available, no detailed history
3. **No Geofencing**: No evidence of geofencing or custom places in current API
4. **Basic Notifications**: Only simple on/off for news notifications

## Recommended Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**:
   - Add rest/sleep sensors
   - Add activity type and place sensors
   - Improve battery monitoring

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Add age calculation
   - Add goal progress tracking
   - Enhance LED control with scheduling

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Photo integration
   - Area-based automations
   - Trend analysis

## Conclusion

While the TryFi API is more limited than initially hoped, there are still several valuable features that can be added to the Home Assistant integration. The focus should be on better exposing the existing data (rest stats, places, areas) and adding calculated sensors (age, goal progress) to provide more value to users.

The biggest gaps are in historical data access and geofencing capabilities, which appear to be limitations of the current API rather than missing implementation in the integration.
