2. **Social Features**
   - Instagram handle attribute

3. **Advanced Diagnostics**
   - Connection statistics per WiFi network
   - GNSS success rate tracking
   - LED usage statistics

## Implementation Notes

### Data Already Available
All the features listed above can be implemented using data that's already being retrieved by the current integration. The main work involves:
1. Parsing additional fields from existing API responses
2. Creating new sensor entities
3. Adding appropriate device classes and units

### Example Sensor Additions

```python
# Battery Health Sensor
battery_health = device_info['bq27421Info']['batteryHealthPercent']

# Battery Temperature Sensor  
battery_temp_k = device_info['bq27421Info']['temperatureK']
battery_temp_c = (battery_temp_k / 10) - 273.15  # Note: temp is in deciKelvin

# Sleep Duration Sensors
daily_sleep = pet.dailySleep  # Already available in fiPet
daily_nap = pet.dailyNap

# Activity Type Sensor
activity_type = pet.activityType  # "OngoingWalk" or "OngoingRest"

# Place Name Sensor
current_place = pet.currPlaceName  # e.g., "Home"
```

## Limitations & Constraints

1. **No Historical Data Access**: The API only provides current state and period summaries
2. **No Geofencing**: No evidence of geofencing or zone management in the API
3. **Limited Notifications**: Only basic on/off for news notifications
4. **No Real-time Tracking**: No websocket or streaming data available

## Conclusion

While the TryFi API is more limited than initially expected, there are numerous valuable features already available in the API responses that aren't exposed in the Home Assistant integration. The highest value additions would be:

1. **Battery health monitoring** - Critical for maintaining collar reliability
2. **Sleep/rest tracking** - Valuable health metrics for pet owners
3. **Enhanced location context** - Place names and activity types
4. **Connection quality monitoring** - For troubleshooting and reliability

These enhancements would significantly improve the user experience without requiring any API changes from TryFi.
